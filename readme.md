This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](https://clueboard.co).

* Download keymap settings [dumbpad_via.json](/keyboards/dumbpad/via/dumbpad_via.json)

* Load the keymap (dumbpad_via.json), File -> Import Keymap
* Configure the keys, it is **automatically saved**
* Use Key Tester to test your new assign settings

### Do NOT remove keyboard **RESET** from the keymap layers
